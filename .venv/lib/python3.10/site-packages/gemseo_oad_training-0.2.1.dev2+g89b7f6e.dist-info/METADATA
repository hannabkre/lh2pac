# gemseo-oad-training

## Overview

`gemseo-oad-training` is a Python package
including an overall aircraft design (OAD) problem of a 150 pax airline flying at Mach 0.78
to be solved using multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO)
for kerosene, cryogenic hydrogen and battery aircraft.

The provided models include:

- the following physics and components:
  geometry, aerodynamics, engine, fuel tank, mass and operating cost,
- the following mission phases:
  take_off, climb, mission, approach.

All these models constitute typical disciplines to be included in a MDO process.

A typical optimization problem that can be solved is:
```
Minimize : Max takeoff weight
with respect to the design variables:
    wing area
    wing aspect ratio
    engine sea level static thrust

subject to general constraint  :
    takeoff field lenght < 1900 m
    approach speed < 135 kt
    300 ft/min < vertical velocity margin
    wing span < 40 m
```

Several variants of this problem are proposed.
